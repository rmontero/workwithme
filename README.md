## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

I best receive feedback — whether positive or negative, through direct and constructive communication. I appreciate when feedback is specific, actionable, and delivered with the intention of helping me grow.

For recognition, I feel most comfortable receiving it in a manner that is both genuine and situationally appropriate. Whether it's a private acknowledgment, a mention in a meeting, or a casual comment, I value sincere praise.

For instance, if you want to commend me for a great piece of advice or a fun Cat Thursday shirt, a thoughtful note or a casual shout-out in a team chat would make my day.

## Work Patterns

I usually work standard business hours, but I'm flexible and can adjust as needed to accommodate different time zones or project deadlines. I prefer to work alone when I need deep focus for tasks like coding or strategic planning. For brainstorming sessions, problem-solving, or project kick-offs, I enjoy working in groups.

My energy levels are highest in the morning, peak again in the early afternoon, and slightly dip post-lunch. I leverage this by scheduling solo work during high-energy periods and collaborative activities during mid-energy times.

## Communication Preferences

**General Communication:**
Async first. When you reach out to me (on Discord, Slack, or Email), you can expect a prompt and thoughtful response. I prioritize clear and concise communication and aim to address queries and feedback efficiently.

**Urgent Matters:**

For urgent issues during working hours, Slack is the best way to get my attention quickly. Outside of working hours, a direct phone call or text message is the most effective.

**Work Communication Outside Hours:**

I try to maintain a healthy work-life balance, so I may not respond immediately to non-urgent messages outside of working hours. However, I remain reachable for critical matters.

**Do Not Disturb Signs:**

When I prefer not to be interrupted, I use indicators like setting my Slack status to "Do Not Disturb" or closing my office door. If my headphones are on and I'm deeply focused, it's a sign I’d prefer minimal interruptions.

## Me Being Me

My cultural tapestry is evergrowing. I have a deep rooted sense of humor that not everyone might appeciate. I am big on empathy and making people feel welcome. If I crack a joke that doesn't translate well or you have a problem with, feel free to let me know and I will do my best to refrain from using humor to establish rapport.

## Pet Peeves

_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand
and empathize with my reactions._

**Help me help you.** One of my key pet peeves is encountering individuals who lack motivation or consistently drag their feet, even after multiple attempts at streamlining their blockers. I value a proactive approach and prefer working with people who have a "rocket strapped to their back"—those who are eager, driven, and ready to tackle challenges head-on. 

My approach is always to focus on solving problems collaboratively and helping team members overcome obstacles, but it can be frustrating when there is a lack of initiative despite efforts to support and guide.

Additionally, I find it challenging when communication is unclear or when feedback is not acted upon in a timely manner. Efficient communication and responsiveness are crucial in maintaining project momentum and achieving our goals.

## Career Goals & Future Interests

My long-term career goals are centered around making a tremendous impact in the tech industry by driving innovation and excellence. I am committed to personal growth and accelerating my learning, aiming to stay at the forefront of emerging technologies. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible, both for myself and for those I work with. By leading high-performing teams and fostering a culture of continuous improvement, I strive to raise the bar and achieve remarkable results.

## Areas for Development

While I strive for excellence in all aspects of my work, I recognize that I'm not perfect. One area I am actively working on is balancing my high standards with patience. My drive for achieving outstanding results can sometimes lead me to push for quicker outcomes than might be feasible. I appreciate constructive feedback and am always open to collaborating on ways to ensure we maintain a balanced pace without compromising quality. If you notice moments where I might be pushing too hard, please feel free to let me know; I am committed to continuous improvement and value support in refining my approach.

## Ask Me About

I’m always excited to talk about my passion for technology, systems architecture, and software development, especially when it comes to innovative solutions and emerging trends. I love diving into discussions about new tech, whether it's advancements in AI, exploring the latest frameworks, or sharing insights from my extensive experience in CMS and web development.

Outside of work, I’m an enthusiastic participant in tech communities and conferences. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, attending meetups, and engaging with others who share my enthusiasm for technology. I also appreciate discussions on how technology intersects with other fields and its impact on society.

In my personal time, I’m a fan of exploring new tech gadgets, working on personal projects, and staying up-to-date with industry trends. I’m always keen to connect with others who have similar interests or who are passionate about making a difference through technology.
